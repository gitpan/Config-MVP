=head1 NAME

Config::MVP::Assembler::WithBundles - a role to make assemblers expand bundles

=head1 VERSION

version 0.093000

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Config::MVP::Assembler::WithBundles is a role to be composed into a
Config::MVP::Assembler subclass.  It allows some sections of configuration to
be treated as bundles.  When any section is ended, if that section represented
a bundle, its bundle contents will be unrolled and will replace it in the
sequence.

A package is considered a bundle if the this returns a defined method:

  my $method = $assembler->package_bundle_method($package);

The default implementation looks for a method callde C<mvp_bundle_config>, but
C<package_bundle_method> can be replaced to allow for other bundle-identifying
information.

Bundles are expanded by having their bundle method called like this:

  my @new_config = $bundle_section->package->$method({
    name    => $bundle_section->name,
    package => $bundle_section->package,
    payload => $bundle_section->payload,
  });

(We pass a hashref rather than a section so that bundles can be expanded
synthetically without having to laboriously create a new Section.)

The returned C<@new_config> is a list of arrayrefs, each of which has three
entries:

  [ $name, $package, $payload ]

Each arrayref is converted into a section in the sequence.
